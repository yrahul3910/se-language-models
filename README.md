# SE Language Models

The goal of this repository is to provide a set of pre-trained language models fine-tuned for the SE domain. We
will use state-of-the-art models, train them, and release the trained models online.


## Getting Started

### Download the data

Please download the datasets from [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange), who host the Stack Exchange data dumps. You may download as many as needed for your application. The torrent method is faster for downloading; we recommend [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php).

### Extract the data

We extract the data using a simple one-line shell script. Install `p7zip` for your system, using the package manager (`brew` for macOS, `apt` for Debian-based systems, `dnf` for Fedora/RHEL-based systems or the Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows). Then, run:

```
for file in *.7z; do mkdir $(basename $file .7z); 7z x $file -o$(basename $file .7z); done
```

This extracts each 7z file to a directory with the same name, sans the extension.
